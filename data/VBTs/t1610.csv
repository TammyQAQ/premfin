Comments:,"Study Data: Built from the 1965-70 Basic Table (See SOA Table Identities 357 and 359) as the original select rates did not grade smoothly into the ultimate rates. The modified tables also provide select rates for all ages rather than age bands. Disconnects between select and ultimate rates were attributed to the fact that the select rates of the 1965-70 Basic Table were built relying solely on medically underwritten policies while ultimate rates were built from both medically and non-medically underwritten policies. Methodology: The Modified 1965-70 Tables use the ultimate rates of the 1965-70 Basic Tables without adjustment. For the select period, in order to maximize fit with the original graduated rates, five durational ratios of the 1965-70 Select Basic Table to the 1965-70 Ultimate Basic Table were chosen. Intervening durational ratios were then calculated using a Lagrangian interpolation formula that fitted a fourth degree polynomial to the known ratios. It was deemed that no selection process is in effect for ages 0-14. Final rates for individual ages were then developed by the use of CURVFIT, an interpolation technique involving the passing of a different cubic polynomial between each pair of points and then fitting these curves together so as to produce on smooth continuous curve. Ultimate rates in the 1965-70 Basic Tables were truncated at age 100. For the Modified tables, it was decided to set q99 to 1.00 and then rates for age 93-98 were obtained by passing a cubic through ages 93, 94, 95 and 99. Despite detracting from the technical beauty desired, empirical adjustments were made whenever a test of reasonableness failed. Data Transcription Errors Detected: 03/2013.
