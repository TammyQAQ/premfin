Table Description:,1975-80 Modified Basic Table with Milliman Extension and Society of Actuaries (SOA) Extension – Female. Basis: Age Nearest Birthday. Minimum Select Age: 0. Maximum Select Age: 99. Minimum Ultimate Age: 15. Maximum Ultimate Age: 120,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EffDate:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Comments:,"Study Data:  Derived from the age grouping rates presented in the “1982 Reports of the Transactions of the Society of Actuaries” as the 1975-80 Select and Ultimate Basic Tables. Those tables were based on the intercompany mortality experience under Standard Ordinary insurance observed between 1975 and 1980 policy anniversaries. Based on medical, paramedical and nonmedical issues combined. Methodology: The Individual Life Experience Committee developed rates to extend the select portion of the table to issue ages 88-90 and attained age 120 in the same fashion as was done by Milliman to extend the select portion of the table through issue age 87 and the ultimate portion of the table to attained age 102 (See SOA Table Identities 1612-1615). Data Transcription Errors: None. Data Certified: 04/2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
