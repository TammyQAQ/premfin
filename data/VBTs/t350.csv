Comments:,"Study Data: Miller’s Table is an attempt to develop select mortality rates consistent with the 1941 Commissioners Standard Ordinary (CSO) Table (See SOA Table Identity 1). Underlying the 1941 CSO Table, for ages up to 50, the basic rates were derived from the experience on issues of 1925 to 1934, inclusive, published by the Joint Committee on Mortality. For the higher ages, data were obtained from nine companies, most of whom submitted experience on all issues, including those prior to 1925 in order to have available as much data as possible for the analysis of the effects of  selection. Methodology: Because of the lack of homogeneity between the several years of issue, graduated select rates could not properly be developed directly from mortality rates adjusted for secular trends. Coefficients of selection were employed where the factors being determined from the original data, adjusted to eliminate trend, by the following formula: CS ([x] + n) = 1 – q([x] + n) / q([n-5] + n + 5). The five year interval does not imply an a priori assumption of a five year select period, but was adopted because the data had been developed for quinquennial ages. The average first year coefficients for ages 27 and over were graduated by fitting a straight line by the method of least squares. For the younger ages a second order curve was passed through 0 at age 7 and the observed values at ages 17 and 27. In order to avoid distortion at age 32 due to an obviously accidental fluctuation, the second and third year coefficients were computed as 54% and 19.4%, respectively, of the first year coefficients. In order to make the table complete, a value for q(0) was inserted. This was done by reference to the extensions of the American Men table by Davis, Hooker and Bowerman (See SOA Table Identity 301). Since the select rates are functions of the ultimate rates, it was considered desirable to use ultimate rates as smooth as possible. Accordingly, the 1930-40 basic rates were smoothed by application of the Henderson-Whittaker Formula A at ages 15 and over and by inspection at the lower ages. Data Transcription Errors: None.
