Comments:,"Study Data: Based on the combined mortality experience submitted by 19 companies on a Standard Ordinary Insurance basis observed between 1965 and 1970 policy anniversaries. The select tables are based on medically examined issues, the ultimate tables on medical and nonmedical issues combined. All war deaths have been excluded in the construction of these tables. Methodology: While most of the companies contributed their data on an age nearest-birthday basis, three companies submitted part of their data on an age-last-birthday basis. Therefore it was necessary to calculate experience mortality ratios, for each issue age and duration cell, on the basis of the 1955-60 Basic Tables (See SOA Table Identities 353-355) to obtain crude mortality rates on an age-nearest-birthday basis and thereby combine the data. The select tables were smoothed with a Bayesian graduation, such that for ages below 15, the 1959-61 U.S. Life Tables for white males, white females, and total whites were taken as the ""prior opinion” while for other ages the 1955-60 Select Basic Tables as the “prior opinion”. The 1959--61 U.S. Life Table rates for 28-365 days were used as the rates at age 0. The crude mortality rates for ages below 15 were calculated on an attained-age basis (that is, disregarding duration since issue). Accordingly, all data for issue age groups 0, 1, 2-4, 5-9, and 10-14 were graduated on an attained-age basis. Wherever necessary, the graduated rates were adjusted empirically to prevent them from exceeding the corresponding ultimate rates or to improve the fit. These adjustments occurred mainly at the younger ages. Ultimate crude mortality rates were graduated by a Whittaker-Henderson second difference Type A formula with a = 1. To facilitate the study of future mortality trends at the higher ages, the Committee decided to extend the ultimate basic tables to attained age 100. Approximate methods were used, since intercompany data were not available for attained ages over 95. NOTE: A prior generation of this table included interpolated select rates created by the transcriber. As these rates were not part of the original publication and they could not be replicated, they have been removed. Select rates were only developed for age 0, 1, ages 2-4 combined, and then quinquennial age breaks thereafter up to age 70. The select table is coded with the value applying to the central age in the range. In 1977 an expanded set of tables with select period rates for all ages and with modified ultimate rates at the advanced ages was published based on the 1965-70 Basic Table (See SOA Table Identities 1610 and 1611).
