Comments:,"Study Data: Intercompany experience between 1990 and 1995 policy anniversaries for medical, nonmedical, and paramedical issues combined. For males, exposures constituted $4.1 trillion with claims amounting to $11.6 billion (See SOA Table 371). For females the corresponding figures are $1.62 trillion and $2.37 billion respectively. Methodology: Graduated rates in the 1985-90 Basic Tables were used to combine the age last and age nearest submissions to maximize the use of the crude data. Crude select mortality rates graduated with a Whittaker-Henderson type A algorithm. For the males the smoothing constant in the graduation formula used was 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 for the issue age groups 0-14, 15-59, 60-64 and 65-74 respectively.  The emphasis on smoothness increases with the increase in issue age due to scarcity of credible data.  The ultimate graduated mortality rates for the 15-year data were similarly created from the crude rates using the Whitaker Henderson type A algorithm with the smoothing constant of 2.0.  The graduation process for the females followed similarly and used a smoothing constant of 3.0 across all age groups for both the select and ultimate rate calculations.  The relative amount of data necessitated the use of a large smoothing coefficient across all ages. NOTE: Mortality rates for issue ages 73 through 99 for the durations 1 to 25 were appended to complete the select portions of the tables for both the males and the females. As the rates are based solely on extrapolation and not on experience, the Committee recommended that caution be exercised in using the rates as there are many different ways to extrapolate from issue ages 73 to 99;  the extrapolated rates were not tested for goodness of fit.
