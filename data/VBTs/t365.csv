Comments:,"Study Data: Society of Actuaries (SOA) intercompany mortality study on Standard Ordinary issues in the United States observed from 1985 to 1990 policy anniversaries. The total dollar amount of exposure was $3.5 trillion and the total claims amounted to $16.1 billion for males; the corresponding figures for the females being $1.07 trillion and $1.51 billion respectively. Medical, nonmedical and paramedical issues combined. Raw data was initially submitted using a 15-year select period. Later in the table construction process, the select data was re-submitted in a 25-year select period format.  Methodology: Years 16 to 25 had much less experience compared to the 1-15 duration data. Therefore data from years 1 to 15 was graduated separately from durations 16 to 25 so that the fit would be most accurate in durations containing the most data.  As data was submitted on both an age last birthday basis and an age nearest birthday basis, the graduated rates in the 1975-80 tables (See SOA Table Identities 360-363) were used to combine the age last and age nearest submissions to maximize the use of the crude data. Data graduated by policy year for each issue age group using a Whitaker-Henderson type A algorithm. Though a 2-dimensional graduation across issue ages and policy year durations is appropriate, it is computationally intensive and thus not pursued. The emphasis on smoothness increased with the increase in issue age due to scarcity of credible data. Mortality rates for issue ages 70 through 99 for the durations 1 to 25 were appended by using select- to-ultimate relationships that exist. Two constraints were placed on the graduated rates: (1) for a given attained age, the select rate for any issue age should be at most equal to the select rate for the next higher issue age. In actuarial notation, q[x]:t+k >= q[x+k]:t and (2) for a given attained age, the ultimate rate should be at least equal to any select rate. Using actuarial notation, qx+t  >=  q[x]:t . Here q[x]:t is the select mortality rate and qx+t is the corresponding ultimate mortality rate for the same attained age. NOTE: Smoking status tables have not been produced.
