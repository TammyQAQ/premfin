Comments:,"Study Data:  Derived from the age grouping rates presented in the “1982 Reports of the Transactions of the Society of Actuaries” as the 1975-80 Select and Ultimate Basic Tables. Those tables were based on the intercompany mortality experience under Standard Ordinary insurance observed between 1975 and 1980 policy anniversaries. Based on medical, paramedical and nonmedical issues combined. Methodology: Rates presented in the 1982 Reports were left intact, and each missing rate was developed by multiplying the interpolated selection factor by the ultimate mortality rate for the applicable attained age, before being rounded to the nearest cent per 1,000 and subjected to consistency tests. The published rates for issue ages 70 and above theoretically cover such a wide age band that they were suspect and hence, the selection factors derived for issue age 67, or more precisely the age grouping 65-69, were used in deriving the select mortality rates for issue ages 68 to 70.
