Comments:,"Study Data:  Derived from the age grouping rates presented in the “1982 Reports of the Transactions of the Society of Actuaries” as the 1975-80 Select and Ultimate Basic Tables. Those tables were based on the intercompany mortality experience under Standard Ordinary insurance observed between 1975 and 1980 policy anniversaries. Based on medical, paramedical and nonmedical issues combined. Methodology: Ultimate rates extrapolated to attained age 102 by keeping second differences constant with those of the original tables. Select rates derived from central death rates. The mortality rates calculated in this manner through the 11th policy year were not modified. After the 11th policy year however, rates were graded into ultimate rates. For the 12th policy year the mortality rate was 80% of the calculated select rate plus 20% of the ultimate rate. For the 13th policy year, the mix was 60% and 40%, 14th year used 40% and 60% and then 15th year utilized 20% and 80% mix respectively. Hence the 16th policy year was 100% of the ultimate rate. Select mortality rates for age 0, 1, 2, 7 and 12 were taken directly from the table of graduated select rates of the original report. Thus a select 15-year table was constructed for issue ages 0, and 1 and then every fifth age from 2 through 87. Intervening issue ages were interpolated by using a polynomial interpolation program.
