Comments:,"Study Data: The underlying data used in developing the 2008 Valuation Basic Table (VBT) was a subset of the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Individual Life Experience Committee's (ILEC) 2002-2004 Intercompany Study comprised of claims from 35 contributing companies. Of these 35 companies, 28 companies maintained preferred class underwriting criteria. Nevertheless, this data proved insufficient to develop all the relationships needed for construction of the Relative Risk tables. Consequently, research from a reinsurer heavily supplemented the data. Methodology: Relative Risk Ratios were developed from an Underwriting Criteria Score (UCS). The Relative Risk Ratios were then applied to the 2008 Primary Table to create 10 preferred non-smoker tables and 4 preferred smoker tables delineated by gender. Next, a Preferred Wear-Off Factor was applied to durations 2 and later. The Wear-Off Factors result in the relative risk tables grading into the corresponding aggregate table at higher attained ages. The Preferred Wear-Off Factors are the same for all the Relative Risk tables. Data Transcription Errors: None. Data Certified: 10/2012.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
