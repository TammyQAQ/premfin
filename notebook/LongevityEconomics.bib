abstract = {We investigate the extent by which real estate markets are integrated with the world market. We apply a case-wise bootstrap analysis - a method that is robust to non-normality and increased volatility that characterises financial markets, especially during periods of distress. We also take into account the effect of the global financial crisis. Our investigation is conducted in relation to five most important and highly internationalised real estate markets, namely, the US, UK, Japan, Australia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We find that the first four markets are integrated with the world market - with Japan, the US, and the UK being the most integrated, but the last one is not. Our results also show that the US real estate market crisis affected the five markets differently. It made the UAE, Australia and the US real estate markets more integrated internationally but resulted in the Japanese market becoming less globally integrated. In the case of the UK, the crisis did not affect at all its level of integration with the world market. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Secondary life insurance markets are growing rapidly. From nearly no transactions in 1980, a wide variety of similar products in this market has developed, including viatical settlements, accelerated death benefits, and life settlements and as the population ages, these markets will become increasingly popular. Eight state governments, in a bid to guarantee sellers a "fair" price, have passed regulations setting a price floor on secondary life insurance market transactions, and more are considering doing the same. Using data from a unique random sample of HIV+ patients, we estimate welfare losses from transactions prevented by binding price floors in the viatical settlements market (an important segment of the secondary life insurance market). We find that price floors bind on HIV patients with greater than 4 years of life expectancy. Furthermore, HIV patients from states with price floors are significantly less likely to viaticate than similarly healthy HIV patients from other states. If price floors were adopted nationwide, they would rule out transactions worth $119 million per year. We find that the magnitude of welfare loss from these blocked transactions would be highest for consumers who are relatively poor, have weak bequest motives, and have a high rate of time preference.},

abstract = {Life insurance settlement (LIS) is a US$15 billion global industry and is expected to grow tenfold or more by 2040. It involves the controversial practice of investors acquiring the life insurance policies of living people and then receiving the proceeds of the policy after the death of the insured. This article examines LIS exchange and consumption from a consumer-focused public policy and marketing perspective. The authors find that the vast potential of LIS to meaningfully expand consumer choice has yet to be fully realized as a result of (1) LIS consumers often being inherently at a high risk of experiencing vulnerability, (2) incosistent and inadequate industry regulation, and (3) ethically or legally questionable industry marketing practices. Public policy recommendations are formulated with a view toward facilitating regulatory reform that benefits both LIS consumers and ethical LIS marketers.},

Second, a comprehensive overview and description of implicit options contained in these contracts is provided. With focus on participating contracts, we present contract design, valuation methods, and main results of several recent articles in this field. The study indicates that current developments regarding regulation (Solvency II, Swiss Solvency Test), accounting (IFRS), customer needs, and secondary life insurance markets may lead to a trend away from traditional contract design of participating policies and toward new products that are of a more transparent modular form such as variable annuities. These new contracts will contain fewer basic guarantees and a set of additional, adequately priced options.},

More recently, a market has developed that allows healthy individuals to sell their life insurance policies to investors for cash amounts exceed ing the policies cash surrender value. This practice has come to be known simply as the lifetime settlements of life insurance contracts. It would appear that life settlement investing is slowly emerging as a popular hedge fund strategy that is uncorrelated with other strategies and markets. State regulators have begun to focus their attention on these arrangements to help ensure that they are undertaken within certain parameters. Investors (and their tax advisors!) would similarly welcome clarity from the IRS with respect to the numerous tax issues involved. In the meantime, investors can only structure and manage their life settlement investments with careful attention paid to the uncertainty arising from the tax variables.},

abstract = {Despite their widespread use as benchmarks of U.S. commercial real estate returns, indexes produced by the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) are subject to measurement problems that severely impair their ability to capture the true risk-return characteristics--especially volatility--of privately held commercial real estate. We utilize latent-variable statistical methods to estimate an alternative index of privately held (unsecuritized) commercial real estate returns. Latent-variable methods have been extensively applied in the behavioral sciences and, more recently, in finance and economics. Unlike factor analysis or other unconditional statistical approaches, latent variable models allow us to extract interpretable common information about unobserved private real estate returns using the information contained in various competing measures of returns that are measured with error. We find that our latent-variable real estate return series is approximately twice as volatile as the aggregate NCREIF total return index, but less than half as volatile as the NAREIT equity index. Overall, our results strongly support the use of latent-variable statistical models in the construction of return series for commercial real estate. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Many equity‐linked life insurance products offer the possibility to surrender policies prematurely. Secondary markets for policies with surrender guarantees influence both policyholders and insurers. We show that secondary markets lead to a gap in policy value between insurer and policyholder. Insurers increase premiums to adjust for higher surrender rates of customers and optimized surrender behavior by investors acquiring the policies on secondary markets. Hence, the existence of secondary markets is not necessarily profitable for the primary policyholders. The result depends on the demand for and the supply of the contracts brought to the secondary markets.},

While thus far this discrepancy has been attributed to the (allegedly) poor quality of the underlying life expectancy estimates, we present a different explanation of the seemingly high reported expected returns based on adverse selection. In particular, we provide a coherent pricing mechanism and pricing formulas in the presence of asymmetric information with respect to the underlying life expectancies. Therefore, our study sheds light on the nature of the “unique risks” within life settlements as recently discussed in the financial press.},

We begin by explaining their business model and the roles of institutions involved in the transactions of such funds. Next, we conduct the first empirical analysis of life settlement fund return distributions as well as a performance measurement, including a comparison to other asset classes. Since the funds contained in our data set cover a large fraction of this relatively young segment of the capital markets, representative conclusions can be derived. Even though the empirical results suggest that life settlement funds offer attractive returns paired with low volatility and are virtually uncorrelated with other asset classes, we find latent risk factors such as liquidity, longevity, and valuation risks. Since these risks did generally not materialize in the past and are hence largely not reflected by the historical data, they cannot be captured by classical performance measures. Thus, caution is advised in order not to overestimate the performance of this asset class.},

The investment method capitalizes the initial investment (purchase price) and continuing costs (policy premiums and direct external costs, if any). As a practical matter every life settlement application involving a variable policy requires special handling. Providers generally are interested in purchasing only the policy's insurance or death benefit component, not the investment component. A few providers are experienced in separating the two components and will consider a variable policy.

The second proposal is to establish markets for perpetual claims on cash flows matching indices of dividends or rents. Such markets may help us to measure the prices of the assets generating these dividends or rents even when the underlying asset prices are difficult or impossible to observe directly. A perpetual futures contract is proposed that would cash settle every day in terms of both the change in the futures price and the dividend or rent index for that day.},

@article{Stone2006,
abstract = {Securitization has been an extremely important technique for managing exposure to a variety of financial risks. It allows the undesired risk to be concentrated in a small proportion of the newly created securities while largely eliminating its impact for most investors. Securitization had its very successful debut with mortgages, as a way to tap into funding from the bond market with mortgage-backed securities that were largely insulated from the inherent exposure of the underlying mortgages to prepayment risk. Since then, it has been extended to a wide range of securities and categories of risk. In this issue's Innovations section, Stone and Zissu describe a new kind of securitization, in which the risk to be managed is the risk of death. Or the opposite, actually: It is "longevity risk," the risk that an insured person will live too long, i.e., longer than their actuarial expected life span. A senior life settlement contract provides a way for a terminally ill, or very old, holder of a life insurance policy to liquidate it and obtain cash prior to death. The article describes how a portfolio of life settlement contracts may be securitized and tranched, and discusses pricing and risk management for the new securities.},

abstract = {The total face amount of terminated life insurance in the U.S. amounts to over two trillion dollars per annum. Little known is that, instead of allowing insurance carriers to pocket the premiums paid until termination and avoid the death claim, many policyholders may realize their policies' value through resale to the secondary market, and receive a lump-sum markedly above the surrender value. By modelling the demand-supply dynamics, we map out how the inclusion of a secondary sale provision in a policy contract will affect — and ultimately benefit — the welfare of policyholders without negatively affecting that of insurance companies.},

@article{Ziser2007,
abstract = {The last 12 months have been very active in the life settlement industry. The life settlement market continued to expand in 2006 and, by some estimates, approximately $15 billion in face amount of policies were sold. Synthetic structures have also become available as a means to invest in life settlements without actually purchasing the physical life insurance policies. In addition to purchasing life settlements, lending into the life settlement market, and providing synthetic investment opportunities, in the past year a number of financial institutions have become part owners of life settlement providers. As further evidence of a maturing market, a number of exchanges, similar to commodities exchanges, are currently in operation, and more may be on the way. Life settlements are governed on a state-by-state basis, with 28 states having enacted laws to govern life settlements and several states having proposed legislation. The primary legislative guide for life settlement regulation has been the Viatical Settlement Model Act, promulgated by the National Asssociation of Insurance Commisioners in 2001. In May 2006, a movement to amend the Model Act began to gather momentum. In an effort to end the so-called stranger-originated life insurance (STOLI) or investor-originated life insurance business segment, the Life Insurance and Annuities (A) Committee proposed a prohibition on the sale of a life insurance policy during the first five years after the policy is issued. While the inexact nature of life expectancy determinations has been one factor that has delayed the arrival of securitization to this sector due to the difficulties encountered by the rating agencies in achieving a sufficient comfort level with life expectancy predictions, many believe that securitization presents the logical progression of the life settlement market.},

@article{Perera2007,
abstract = {Investors transacting in life settlement policies face many risks. But the most often raised concern from any life settlement investor surrounds extension risk, which is the probability that an insured individual lives well beyond his or her life expectancy. The risk presents two problems: 1) that the death benefit arrives later but does not grow with time and 2) that the ongoing premiums drain the investment returns. However, with the consumer market pressing to cash in their insurance policies, equity investors expanding the life settlement market may find emerging mortality solutions will bring bankers to the table. This article explores several solutions that mitigate the mortality uncertainty and enable the successful execution of financial transactions. A life-contingent, single-premium annuity structure combines a single-premium immediate annuity with a settled life insurance policy, incorporating debt-like characteristics of principal protection while providing the necessary mortality hedge. Residual value insurance has been developed to insure a policy's future value, making premium finance programs that use traditional lending more efficient. Mortality index swaps, which utilize recently developed mortality indices, allow life settlement providers and life insurance companies to indirectly hedge each others' risks. Principal protection insurance protects a life settlement portfolio manager from extended life expectancy over an entire portfolio. Now with the innovative risk mitigation solutions emerging, investors are able to combine traditional lending facilities with mortality risk transfer products and thus deploy capital more efficiently towards life settlements.},

@article{Richmond2012,
abstract = {Stranger-owned life insurance, commonly known by the acronym STOLI, has for several years been a key practice of the so-called life settlements industry. STOLI generally describes the purchase of life insurance by an insured with the intent of assigning ownership of the policy along with its death benefits to investors who do not have an insurable interest in the insured's life. State statutes regulating STOLI arrangements often define STOLI in this way. This is not a perfect description or definition of STOLI, however, because life settlement companies may purchase life insurance policies from individuals over the age of 65 who have remaining life expectancies of six to twelve years (although in some instances people with longer life expectancies may be considered), but who did not originally purchase their policies with the intent to transfer ownership of them to strangers. Insureds in this second category may seek to sell their policies because of shifts in personal financial preferences or due to changes in their circumstances, such as disability, divorce, retirement, or various forms of financial distress. This is still strangerowned life insurance, even if the original intent to transfer policy ownership is missing. [...]of these differences, and while the mechanics of STOLI transactions may vary-they commonly involve major cash payments to insureds by intermediaries or investors, the formation of irrevocable life insurance trusts, and premium financing, among other techniques9- STOLI is unquestionably more an investment vehicle than an insurance transaction. The basic concept is that the life settlement company that purchases the policy will pay the insured an amount greater than the cash surrender value of the policy but much less than the death benefit, will thereafter keep the policy in force until the insured dies, and will then profit by collecting the difference between the death benefit and the combination of the sum paid to the insured and the premiums paid to keep the policy in force.11 Life settlements may be securitized, such that investors who purchase the resulting bonds profit in essentially the same fashion.},

Public awareness and acceptance of the product has gained traction as thousands of seniors turn to the secondary market each year to maximize the value of their unwanted life insurance policies. In addition to the fact that institutional investors are fueling the product's growth, most insiders agree that the marketplace is being propelled by a financially sophisticated, aging population, as they discover that an economically sensible exit strategy from unwanted life insurance policies does indeed exist. Although thousands of life settlement transactions are being sourced through agents, brokers, and providers, much of the market potential remains untapped due to product-flow constraints. Furthermore, approximately 80% of the policies presented to funders never make it to the cash register for various reasons. This article presents a general overview of the life settlement market, examines the dynamics and players involved in product flow, and identifies the main drivers and constraints in sourcing policies at the point of sale.},

abstract = {Project Description: The purpose of this paper is to provide a general overview of the deterministic and probabilistic pricing methodologies, and the application of the common contributing factors in determining the price of life insurance policies for life settlements in the secondary market. This paper does not venture into an analysis or review of the internal economics provided by life insurance policies. Scope of Research/Methodology: The life settlement market has grown exponentially from its roots in the 1980's as a viatical industry, to today's multi-billion dollar life insurance secondary market. One of the principal facilitators of this expanding asset class is the evolution of more accurate and reliable pricing models used by institutional investors to value life insurance policies. Understanding the basics of these pricing models also helps policy owners and their advisors to be informed market participants. This paper underscores the two fundamental methodologies that are used today, Deterministic Pricing and Probabilistic Pricing, and examines the fundamental similarities and differences in these methods, and how those factors impact investors. In particular, this report scrutinizes the importance of the underlying mortality assumptions, and the internal rate of return that is calculated based upon those assumptions. Target Results/Benefits: Concisely describe the primary pricing methodologies that are utilized to value life insurance policies for life settlements.

Other theorists seem to disregard the problem altogether. In the present discussion we intend to go to the other extreme, by concentrating entirely on the uncertainty of lifetime and ignoring the other uncertainties which a consumer must normally cope with. The uncertainty of future earnings, for instance, will enter the discussion only insofar as the flow of earnings stops when the consumer dies.},

abstract = {In response to the financial hardships burdening AIDS patients and other terminally ill individuals, the "viatical settlement" industry has emerged. Although as a general rule the purchaser of an insurance policy must possess an insurable interest in the insured's life, controversy exists as to whether a person without an insurable interest, such as a viatical settlement company, may obtain an insurance policy by assignment. This goal is accomplished by requiring viatical settlement companies to procure a witnessed, signed statement from the terminally ill individual attesting that the viator freely consents to the contract, acknowledges the illness, understands the risks and benefits of the settlement, and releases all medical records to the viatical company. Opponents contend that licensing requirements stifle a terminally ill individual's opportunity to take full advantage of the viatical settlement industry by excluding willing purchasers from the market. The ruling addressed a taxpayer's irrevocable assignment of a life insurance policy to a viatical settlement company for approximately sixty-three percent of the policy's face value. The Service ruled that amounts received from the assignment of the life insurance policy to the viatical settlement company were "not amounts received under a life insurance contract by reason of the death of the insured.},

abstract = {Private equity has traditionally been thought to provide diversification benefits  However, these benefits may be lower than anticipated. We find that private equity suffers from significant exposure to the same liquidity risk factor as public equity and other alternative asset classes. The unconditional liquidity risk premium is close to 3% annually and, in a four-factor model, the inclusion of this liquidity risk premium reduces alpha to zero. In addition, we provide evidence that the link between private equity returns and overall market liquidity occurs via a funding liquidity channel.

Although life settlements evolved from the viatical settlement market in the 1980s, which was dominated by individual investors who purchased policies from terminally ill AIDS patients, the industry has undergone a change resulting in a shift in the product's demographic focus. With this shift in focus from terminally ill insureds to high-networth seniors generally over age 70 seeking an exit strategy from unwanted policies, the industry entered a new era of sophistication and a new stage of the product life cycle that brought greater credibility and a clearly defined value proposition for all players in the life settlement supply chain.},

Advisors will generally find that life settlement companies are unwilling to make substantive modifications to their documents, and there may be valid business reasons for this position. Even if changes are not accepted, there are a number of important issues the advisor should consider in the document review process. Advisors should complete a thorough credit check on the provider and funder, and ask whether the policy is being bought to be sold or to be held. Advisors, particularly those who sign the policy owner's tax return, should not overlook the fact that life insurance contracts are unique assets subject to special tax rules. Also, loan interest should be carefully reviewed.},

In some instances the best alternative is neither to hold the policy nor to surrender it. This article explains how CPAs can use a third option-a life settlement-to help eligible clients and employers dispose of unneeded life insurance policies now for more than the cash value rather than wait for the policy to pay off at the insured's death. A life settlement turns insurance assets into cash, giving the original policyholder an amount greater than the cash surrender value in exchange for ownership of the policy. This option creates immediate revenue for companies or individuals holding unprofitable or unneeded policies. When an individual or business engages in a life settlement transaction, the amount it recoups is based on the policy's face amount and cash surrender value as well as other factors, such as the insured's health, age and the current policy premium.},

abstract = {... So, the industry shifted to buying life insurance policies insuring the lives of people with other terminal illnesses; then, to buying policies of old people who were not terminally ill; then, to encouraging older people to buy insurance policies for the express purpose of selling them to investors; and finally, to bundling those policies together, securitizing them, and selling pieces of the bundles to investors. ... On his application, Rucker said the policy was not going to be transferred to investors, and investors were not going to pay the policy premiums. ... The court noted that incontestability clauses operate as statutes of limitations that keep insurance companies from continuing to collect premiums and reap profits until they have to pay out on policies, which they will refuse to do by claiming fraud or lack of insurable interest. ... As in most of them, the new Arizona statute provides that insureds may not enter into life settlement contracts within two years of the issuance of policies, with exceptions similar to those in the New York statute. ... Arizona's statute suggests legislators there, like legislators in almost all other states with similar statutes, had a great deal of concern about promoters of life settlement agreements engaging in fraud and encouraging insureds and investors to enter into transactions that were not appropriate for them. ... States became more amenable to various gambling enterprises because they were a source of revenue for the government. ... Although life insurance companies oppose life settlements, they also provide the policies for those arrangements by encouraging consumers to purchase whole life policies (and their variants) instead of term insurance. ... Other risks for investors in life settlement funds include: liquidity risk because cash outflows to pay premiums and fund redemptions occur regularly, whereas cash inflows from death benefits and new investments are unpredictable; policy availability risk; operational risks including litigation that can cost more than the death benefits; credit risk caused by the possible failure of the insurance carriers that underwrite the policies; and regulation risk because of changes in state and federal laws.},

abstract = {The payment of life insurance policy benefits to the insured's suriving spouse or child is something with which most people are both familiar and comfortable. However, when those benefits are instead paid to a third party investor who has no interest in the insured's life, some people cry foul. Yet this is the basic premise of the secondary market for life insurance. In this market, insured individuals assign their policy benefits to an investor who agrees to pay the insured a lump sum of money in addition to assuming responsibility for the policy's premiums. While the underlying concepts that support the secondary market for life insurance policies are not new, the young and imperfectly regulated market has been strained by an increase in supply and demand for these products. Because of the limited guidance within the market, fraud and uncertainty have pervaded many transactions. As a result, many validly settled policies may face challenges in the courts. In an effort to help stabilize and legitimize the secondary market, this Comment recommends coupling a strict judicial interpretation of the incontestability periods contained in many life insurance policies with a five year holding period on newly issued life insurance policies. This framework will help deter fraudulent transactions while promoting certainty among investors.},

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to explain the spread between rates on corporate and government bonds. We show that expected default accounts for a surprisingly small fraction of the premium in corporate rates over treasuries. While state taxes explain a substantial portion of the difference, the remaining portion of the spread is closely related to the factors that we commonly accept as explaining risk premiums for common stocks. Both our time series and cross-sectional tests support the existence of a risk premium on corporate bonds. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE is to examine and explain the differences in the rates offered on corporate bonds and those offered on government bonds $\sim$spreads!, and, in particular, to examine whether there is a risk premium in corporate bond spreads and, if so, why it exists. Spreads in rates between corporate and government bonds differ across rating classes and should be positive for each rating class for the following reasons: 1. Expected default loss-some corporate bonds will default and investors require a higher promised payment to compensate for the expected loss from defaults. 2. Tax premium-interest payments on corporate bonds are taxed at the state level whereas interest payments on government bonds are not. 3. Risk premium-The return on corporate bonds is riskier than the return on government bonds, and investors should require a premium for the higher risk. As we will show, this occurs because a large part of the risk on corporate bonds is systematic rather than diversifiable. The only controversial part of the above analyses is the third point. Some authors in their analyses assume that the risk premium is zero in the corporate bond market. 1},

The life settlement industry and their solicitors have created the image that many policy owners often come to the rational conclusion they want to sell their life insurance policies and then contact an agent.

abstract = {Using a dataset of 1328 mature private equity funds, we find that performance estimates found in previous research and used as industry benchmark are overstated. We show that in commonly used samples, accounting values reported by mature funds for non-exited investments are substantial and we provide evidence that these mostly represent living dead investments. We also document a bias towards better performing funds in these data. After correcting for sample bias and overstated accounting values, average fund performance changes from a slight overperformance to a substantial underperformance of 3% per year with respect to the S&P 500. Assuming a typical fee structure, we find that gross-of-fees these funds outperform by 3% per year. We conclude that the stunning growth in the amount allocated to this asset class cannot be attributed to genuinely high past net performance. We discuss several potentially misleading aspects of standard performance reporting and discuss some of the added benefits of investing in private equity funds as a first step towards an explanation for our results.},

abstract = {Using duration to measure interest rate risk for securities such as MBS, callable bonds, and securities backed by life insurance policies is problematic because for these securities the timing of cash flows is uncertain. In order to measure duration for securities with embedded options like callable bonds and MBS, cash flow timing must be assumed or modeled. In the case of senior life settlements, duration is only a useful summary of interest rate risk if the estimated life of the insured is accurate. It is precisely because the life of the insured is uncertain that the duration of a pool of senior life settlement contracts will not offer a meaningful summary of interest rate risk. In this paper we illustrate how a pool of senior life settlement contracts can be funded with a capital structure that is composed of two classes of securities: one which has a duration that is insulated from variations in the life of the insured around the estimated life expectancy and the other with a duration which is highly sensitive to variations in the life of the insured around the estimated life expectancy. We name the security class with a stable duration the planned duration class (PDC) while the class with the unstable duration is called the support duration class (SDC)},

In this article, we aim to quantify the effect of altered surrender behavior--subject to the health status of an insured--in a portfolio of life insurance contracts on the surrender profits of primary insurers. Our model includes mortality heterogeneity by applying a stochastic frailty factor to a mortality table. We additionally analyze the impact of the premium payment method by comparing results for annual and single premium payments.},

abstract = {Fair value accounting aims to establish a three-level hierarchy that distinguishes (1) readily observable measurement inputs from (2) less readily observable measurement inputs and (3) unobservable measurement inputs. Level 3 longevity valued assets will pose unique valuation risks once securitised pools of these alternative asset classes come to market as investment vehicles for pension plans and individual retirement accounts. No uniform framework is available to assure consistent fair market valuation and transparency for investor decision-making. Applying existing international auditing standards and analytical procedures (IFRS 13) will offer a platform upon which fund managers, their auditors and actuaries can agree upon uniform valuation and presentation guidelines. Application of these quasi-governmental standards will bring future liquidity to otherwise illiquid capital market instruments. This paper presents a valuation methodology consistent with fair value accounting and auditing standards. The methodology incorporates the longevity predictive modelling of Stallard in a form that is compatible with Bayes Factor weighted average valuation techniques based on the study by Kass and Raftery. The methodology is applicable to fair valuation of life settlement portfolios where the combination of too few large death benefit policies and large variances in individual life expectancy estimates currently challenge accurate valuation and periodic re-valuation.},

@article{Biffis2009,
abstract = {In the last few years, the risk of mortality improvements has become increasingly capital intensive for pension funds and annuity providers to manage. The reason is that longevity risk has been systematically underestimated, making balance sheets vulnerable to unexpected increases in liabilities. The traditional way of transferring longevity risk is through insurance and reinsurance markets. However, these lack the capacity and liquidity to support an estimated global exposure in excess of $20tr (e.g., Loeys et al., 2007). Capital markets, on the other hand, could play a very important role, offering additional capacity and liquidity to the market, leading in turn to more transparent and competitive pricing of longevity risk. Blake and Burrows (2001) were the first to advocate the use of mortality-linked securities to transfer longevity risk to the capital markets. Their proposal has generated considerable attention in the last few years, and major investment banks and reinsurers are now actively innovating in this space (see Blake et al., 2008, for an overview). Nevertheless, despite growing enthusiasm, longevity risk transfers have been materializing only slowly. One of the reasons is the huge imbalance in scale between existing exposures and willing hedge suppliers. Another reason is that a traded mortality-linked security has to meet the different needs of hedgers (concerned with hedge effectiveness) and investors (concerned with liquidity and with receiving adequate compensation for assuming the risk), needs that are difficult to reconcile when longevity risk, a long-term trend risk that is difficult to quantify, is involved. A third reason is the absence of an established market price for longevity risk. We provide an overview of the recent developments in capital markets aimed at overcoming such difficulties and at creating a liquid market in mortality-linked securities and derivatives.},

For example, prospective longitudinal studies of normal populations provide evidence that various types of subjective well‐being such as positive affect predict health and longevity, controlling for health and socioeconomic status at baseline. Combined with experimental human and animal research, as well as naturalistic studies of changes of subjective well‐being and physiological processes over time, the case that subjective well‐being influences health and longevity in healthy populations is compelling. However, the claim that subjective well‐being lengthens the lives of those with certain diseases such as cancer remains controversial. Positive feelings predict longevity and health beyond negative feelings. However, intensely aroused or manic positive affect may be detrimental to health. Issues such as causality, effect size, types of subjective well‐being, and statistical controls are discussed.},

Institutional investors and sophisticated individual investors are searching for investment returns that are not linked to bonds, equities, or commodities. In the late 1990s investment bankers and hedge fund investment managers turned to the secondary market for life insurance to create such an investment class-life settlement-backed securities. The demand for the new securities had been so great, prior to the financial crisis that began last fall, that syndicators and promoters required amounts of life insurance on older-age individuals that exceeded the supply available through normal functioning of the secondary market. The unprecedented demand for life policies on older-aged individuals produced life insurance applications and arrangements that tested the boundaries of state insurable interest laws. This article will explain the tension between life settlement-backed securities and state insurable interest laws.

The purpose of this research is to shed some light on this innovative insurance transaction by providing a clearer understanding of the controversy created by the STOLI phenomenon, and to argue that regulatory action aimed at restricting or prohibiting these transactions seems unnecessary. After examining the controversy generated by STOLI transactions from the perspective of consumers, insurance carriers, and state insurance regulators, we review the primary initiatives to regulate STOLI transactions, analyze the concerns that have been raised about these transactions, and conclude with proposals for market-based solutions and other reforms to address these concerns and other issues that have given rise to the STOLI controversy.},

In order to identify the main determinants of the cat bond spread at issuance, a series of OLS regressions with heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors is run. Our results confirm the expected loss as the most important factor. Apart from that, covered territory, sponsor, reinsurance cycle, and the spreads on comparably rated corporate bonds exhibit a major impact. Based on these findings, we then propose an econometric pricing model for cat bonds in the primary market that is applicable across territories, perils, and trigger types. It exhibits a robust fit across different calibration subsamples and achieves a higher in-sample and out-of-sample accuracy than several competing specifications that have been introduced in earlier work.},

Differences among the conceptions are considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its success in organizing practices, perceptions, and understandings about markets and death. From this case, the author draws implications for analyses of morals in markets, an important and emergent topic within economic sociology.},

Mark's life insurance is viewed as other investments he has, thus the logic of wishing to pursue selling some of his policies to diversify his perceived risk with AB Life. Mark noticed an ad from a local agent promising results, so he called the agent. The agent hooked up with a settlement broker and they were very lucky that during this period a buyer for AB Life did emerge. This wasn't lucky for Mark because this meant large commissions would be subtracted from the purchase price.},

abstract = {Life insurance settlements, or life settlements, are life insurance policies owned by investor-beneficiaries on the lives of unrelated individuals. With life settlements, investors make substantial payments to the insured individuals upon purchasing such policies, pay any remaining premiums, and collect the death benefits upon the demise of the insured individuals. Transactions involving life settlements seem poised to become a major source of profits for investment banks, comparable in dollar amount to subprime mortgages. With life settlements, the insured individuals suffer no immediate harm, and the sale of a policy an individual owns is permissible under current law. Nevertheless, moral questions can be posed about the social values expressed by these practices, the effect of these practices on the virtue of charity, and the overall loss of social utility that will result from life settlements. We consider life settlements from utilitarian and libertarian perspectives, and then consider the effects of life settlements on social values and on individual character. On balance, we favor legislative changes in insurance and tax laws to discourage life settlements, and argue that certain forms of life settlements should be banned outright.},

This lack of standardization has been and still is the major roadblock against widespread use of life settlements as investment, diversication and portfolio risk management tools. However, the recent crisis of 2007 has revealed high levels of correlation among existing financial instruments that are in widespread use. This revelation raised an avid interest in new financial instruments that show low correlation to strong market swings. In this respect, life settlements and related products such as death bonds have gained popularity among practitioners and academics alike. This paper proposes a standard pricing framework for life settlements that is consistent with existing methods of risk management and sensitivity analysis widely used in fixed income products.},

Regulated by 30 state insurance departments (including Puerto Rico) and, in part, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), this industry has validated itself by creating a secondary market for life insurance policies to the benefit of consumers as well as an asset class for investors that is uncorrelated with the credit and investment risk of the typical money manager's portfolio. That said, the second half of 2008 through 2009 thus far has proven to be the most challenging of times this industry has experienced. For reasons brought about by the global economy as well as reasons indigenous to this industry, the life settlement community finds itself in a state of chaos. This article reviews the reasons behind such turmoil and examines the confluence of external and internal forces resulting in this financial perfect storm. It also explores the potential remedies and other factors that provide hope that this industry will not only survive, but prevail, in the long run.},

Specifically, their results suggest that LS funds provide the largest diversification and risk-reduction benefit in combination with fixed income, equity, and commodities funds.

abstract = {The value of a life settlement investment, manifested through a traded life insurance policy, is highly dependent on the insured's life expectancy (LE). LE estimation in life settlements relies heavily on medical underwriting. Employing different evaluation processes, underwriters rarely agree on LE estimates, leading to valuation disparities. We use the natural logarithm of the implied mortality multiplier (In k) to compare the underwriting results of the four major U.S. medical underwriters (ITM, AVS, Fasano, and LSI). k is normalized in terms of gender, age, and smoking status, and is therefore a more suitable indicator than LE estimates for high-level comparisons, especially when the compared groups have a heterogeneous make-up. Based on the analysis of life settlement samples from 2011 to 2016, we trace patterns of underwriters' k in both secondary and tertiary markets of life settlements, and investigate systematic differences in their estimation. Our results show that an underwriter can, relative to peers, act more conservatively (issuing longer LE estimates) for one cohort while more aggressively (issuing shorter LE estimates) for another. We also detect signs of intermediaries' cherry-picking behavior and discuss additional theories that shed light on the convoluted LE landscape.},

abstract = {Investors seeking new structures for acquiring policies in the life settlement market encounter several underlying risks unique to the asset class. Those risks, described in this article, include contestability risk, missing body risk, insurable interest risk, incorrect-purchase-price risk, life insurance company credit risk, cost-of-insurance risk, and longevity risk. Some risks can be easily mitigated, but others require more complicated risk transfer mechanisms that combine financial products with insurance products. These products range from contestability coverage to more sophisticated mortality risk transfer constructs that blend equity derivative products with property casualty insurance. As the life settlement market evolves, risk mitigation will play an increasing role in reducing volatility and enabling predictable returns to allow for more institutional capital participation. Knowledge about the risks and the available risk mitigation solutions becomes a must for prospective investors interested in entering into the life settlement market.},

abstract = {In this article we illustrate how the yield on an investment in a block of life settlement contracts changes across prices paid for the policies and how the yield for an offered price changes when the actual life of the insured extends beyond life expectancy. The reader will see that earning yields between 7% and 11%, figures that have in the last few years been touted in the life settlement industry, are associated with offers for policies that are relatively high discounts from face value, and that even a six-month extension in life beyond the life expectancy reduces the actual yield an investor will earn, below the 7% to 11% range. Once fees are deducted each period, which is the way the managers and owners of investment funds are compensated, the discount from face value consistent with each yield is reduced even further. Our objective has not been to find the appropriate discount rate for a pool of senior life settlements but more simply to illustrate how the required yield on an actual block of life settlement contracts dictates the price that investors can offer for policies. We also show that as required returns increase, the value that can be offered for life settlement contracts approaches the cash surrender value.},

The insured is paid the present, or "discounted," amount of the death benefit, the viatical settlement provider using the same method that an insurance company might use. In most situations, the viatical settlement provider, now the owner of the insurance policy, assumes the costs and benefits of maintaining the policy: paying premiums to prevent the policy from lapsing, collecting dividends, and receiving the insured's death benefit when death occurs. A viator's sale or assignment of an insurance policy to a qualified viatical settlement provider must be of a life insurance contract. E. Failure to tender the viatical settlement by the date disclosed to the viator renders the contract null and void. Further Federal regulation of the viatical settlement industry may ultimately arise due to the increased scrutiny of the industry by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), especially in the wake of new viatical settlement provider investment strategies and outbreaks of broker malfeasance.},

Before clients abandon old policies, CPAs should step in and help them recover the potentially significant wealth that may be trapped there.

The second is a group that actually settled their policies. The third is a group of college-educated seniors; some have insurance policies and belong in the first two groups as well. The paper then focuses on the two life-settlement populations, examining their different survival experience as being indicative of the effect of insureds and investors selecting against each other. However, it is only when different eras of the life-settlement market are examined that this selection effect can be better defined. The paper concludes that the life-settlement transaction provides opportunities for both investors and insureds to exercise selection during the process and, throughout the short history of the life-settlement industry, each has tried to do so, with varying degrees of success.},

Using the repeat sales method to measure returns over our 1993-2009 sample period, we find that policy returns average about 8 percent annually compared to 5.5 percent for the S&P 500 and 7 percent for corporate bonds, but they are twice as volatile as the S&P and four times as volatile as bonds. Nevertheless, because the index return is relatively uncorrelated with stock or bond returns, life insurance policies make attractive additions to well-diversified portfolios.},

This article will look at the legal and ethical issues surrounding one of the issues profiled on American Greed, namely stranger-owned life insurance. A critic of some in the industry is Open Life Settlements. They explain that a person who cannot afford to keep up the payments on a whole life policy can benefit by selling it rather than just turning it in for the cash settlement value. Open Life Settlements helps people who have bought insurance for legitimate reasons sell policies that are now unwanted or unneeded due to changed circumstances.},

abstract = {As a step towards understanding whether a private equity governance structure reduces overall agency conflicts relative to a public equity governance structure (as is often argued), this paper describes the contracts between private equity funds and investors, and the returns earned by investors. The paper sets the stage with a puzzle: the average performance of private equity funds is above that of the Standard and Poor's 500—the main public stock market index—before fees are charged, but below that benchmark after fees are charged. Why are the payments to private equity buyout funds so large? Why does the marginal investor invest in buyout funds? I explore one potential answer (and probably the most controversial): that some investors are fooled. I show that the fee contracts for these funds are opaque. Considering this and the way that compensation contracts bury, in details, costly provisions that are difficult to justify on the basis of proper incentive alignment, it would be premature to assert that the agency conflicts are lower in private equity than in public equity.},

abstract = {In April 2006, the American Council of Life Insurers (ACLI) circulated a legislative proposal that would impose a 100 percent excise tax on the proceeds from the sale of a life insurance policy to a third-party within five years of the issuance of the policy. The practical effect of such a rule would be to increase the holding period for a life-insurance policy from two to five years. Although the proposal has not yet garnered sufficient support in Congress, as of April 2008, the five-year holding period was being considered as 'model legislation' by several U.S. states. To measure the costs of the ACLI proposal to policyowners, we introduce the real options framework of financial economics. The option to sell can be modeled using traditional Black-Scholes techniques as a European put option during the holding period and as an American put option after the holding period expires. We calculate that the senior candidates for a life settlement would instantaneously lose between U.S.$41 billion and U.S.$63 billion in option value if the ACLI's proposal were implemented. Against these costs, one must measure the likely benefits of extending the holding period. Until such a cost-benefit analysis is performed, it would be imprudent to constrain policyholders in such a severe way.},

abstract = {This Article analyzes the benefits that accrue to policyholders and incumbent insurers from an active secondary market for life insurance policies. It begins by examining the benefits of secondary markets in the home mortgage and catastrophic risk insurance industries as points of comparison for the benefits of the secondary market for life insurance policies. Next, it outlines the economic theory of a life insurance market both before and after the introduction of a secondary market. Without an active secondary market, the equilibrium quantity of "impaired'' policies surrendered is inefficiently low. Although competition among insurance companies in the primary market leads to reasonably competitive surrender values given normal health, surrender values based on normal health do not appropriately compensate individuals with impaired life expectancies for the resulting appreciation of their policies. If no external market for reselling policies exists, insurers have no incentive to adjust their surrender values for impaired policies to competitive levels because they wield monopsony power over the repurchase of impaired policies. Entry by firms in the secondary market erodes monopsony power. Finally, the Article examines the benefits of an active secondary market for life insurance policies to policyholders and incumbent insurers in the primary market and discusses the future of life settlements. The magnitude of the benefits is correlated positively to the quantity of coverage sold to life settlement firms and to the improvement in the terms of accelerated death benefits offered by incumbent carriers. The emergence of the secondary market for life insurance policies has been pro-competitive and pro-consumer. Lawmakers should therefore design regulations that encourage, rather than dissuade, participation and investment in this secondary market.},

In 2016 the life settlement market posted strong trading numbers in the secondary market as well as in the tertiary market. The sometimes fierce competition turned out to be advanta-geous for sellers in the secondary and tertiary market alike, and was proof how valuable the proprietary net-works of the life settlement providers are for investors to get attractive offerings. We have seen plenty of fantastic deals in our data collection, but access turned out to be key in 2016. And while IRRs in the market slightly declined life settlements still offer a significant pick-up versus in-vestments of similar credit quality. The 'AAP Life Settlement Reference Rate— Main Market' has risen from 14.5% in October to 15.1% in November. And to close the last market update for the year we say a great 'Thank You' to the providers which send regularly their closed transactions for this re-port, compare the list below. And we appreciate if all readers consider them for their investments in 2017. The information in this report is col-lected by AAP on a multi provider basis. The transparent life settlement providers are (in alphabetical order): Chart of the month – IRRs over time Last month's article showed how the AAP Life Settlement Reference Rate slightly declined over the last couple of years.

abstract = {In the life settlements industry, life expectancy (LE) providers are firms that conduct health underwriting toward predicting the future mortality of an insured. Multiple stakeholders are interested in evaluating the quality of their assessments. There has been some recent interest in better alternatives to the traditional metric for this quality, the A/E ratio: the ratio of actual to expected number of deaths. One such alternative is the implied difference in life expectancies (IDLE) metric proposed by Bauer et al. Its design largely retains the simplicity of the A/E ratio while being informative, unlike the A/E ratio, throughout the life of a policy block. Even though the IDLE is a significant improvement over the A/E ratio, it turns out that the IDLE is sensitive to departures from a key assumption, which motivates our development of a more robust metric. Our proposed methodology for evaluating the quality of the LE assessments involves using a survival regression model for estimating the mortality distribution of the insureds, with the average deviation of the life assessments from those derived using this model serving as a metric. In particular, we show that utilizing a Cox proportional hazards model with covariates derived from the LE assessments results in a robust yet well-performing alternative to both the A/E ratio and the IDLE.},

In 2010 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission organized a Life Settlement Task Force to examine the business and made a key recommendation to amend the definition of a “security” to include all life settlements. Judicial activity continued in 2010 on issues such as an insurance company's claim that insurable interest was lacking at the time a policy was issued and allegations of fraud. Portfolio sales are among the most active segments of the life settlement market today.},

abstract = {The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the "NAIC") voted on June 4, 2007 to approve certain proposed amendments to its 2001 Viatical Settlements Model Act (the "Model Act"). The amendments contain a number of useful updates to the prior NAIC model act adopted in 2001 that are aimed at protecting consumers, while others, if ultimately adopted by state legislatures, would appear to be squarely aimed at stifling the rapidly developing life settlement market. While the NAIC voted to approve the proposed amendments as a new model act, it is unlikely that many states will adopt the new Model Act in its adopted form, in view of certain overreaching provisions that are contained in the model. Ironically, the amended Model Act most likely will result in a much greater diversification of life settlement statutes among states that regulate life settlements, rather than the national uniform standard that the NAIC had perhaps hoped would result from its efforts. Adding to the mixed response to the Model Act, the National Conference of Insurance Legislators ("NCOIL"), a non-governmental organization comprised of state legislators involved in insurance legislation, has been reviewing and revising its own model act governing life settlements.},

abstract = {A life settlement is a financial transaction in which the owner of a life insurance policy sells his or her policy to a third party. We present an overview of the life settlement market, exhibit its susceptibility to longevity risk, and discuss it as part of a new asset class of longevity-related securities. We discuss pricing where the investor has updated information concerning the expected life expectancy of the insured as well as perhaps other medical information obtained from a medical underwriter. We show how to incorporate this information into the investor's valuation in a rigorous and statistically justified manner. To incorporate medical information, we apply statistical information theory to adjust an appropriate prespecified standard mortality table so as to obtain a new mortality table that exactly reflects the known medical information.Weillustrate using several mortality tables including a new extension of the Lee-Carter model that allows for jumps in mortality and longevity over time. The information theoretically adjusted mortality table has a distribution consistent with the underwriter's projected life expectancy or other medical underwriter information and is as indistinguishable as possible from the prespecified mortality model. An analysis using several different potential standard tables and medical information sets illustrates the robustness and versatility of the method.},

An individual may also be deemed chronically ill if she is certified by a licensed health care practitioner within the preceding twelve month period as having a level of disability similar to the level of disability described above, or requiring substantial supervision to protect such an individual from threats to health and safety due to severe cognitive impairment.

abstract = {Subjective wellbeing and health are closely linked to age. Three aspects of subjective wellbeing can be distinguished-evaluative wellbeing (or life satisfaction), hedonic wellbeing (feelings of happiness, sadness, anger, stress, and pain), and eudemonic wellbeing (sense of purpose and meaning in life). We review recent advances in the specialty of psychological wellbeing, and present new analyses about the pattern of wellbeing across ages and the association between wellbeing and survival at older ages. The Gallup World Poll, a continuing survey in more than 160 countries, shows a U-shaped relation between evaluative wellbeing and age in high-income, English speaking countries, with the lowest levels of wellbeing in ages 45-54 years. But this pattern is not universal. For example, respondents from the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe show a large progressive reduction in wellbeing with age, respondents from Latin America also shows decreased wellbeing with age, whereas wellbeing in sub-Saharan Africa shows little change with age. The relation between physical health and subjective wellbeing is bidirectional. Older people with illnesses such as coronary heart disease, arthritis, and chronic lung disease show both increased levels of depressed mood and impaired hedonic and eudemonic wellbeing. Wellbeing might also have a protective role in health maintenance. In an analysis of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, we identify that eudemonic wellbeing is associated with increased survival; 29{\textperiodcentered}3% of people in the lowest wellbeing quartile died during the average follow-up period of 8{\textperiodcentered}5 years compared with 9{\textperiodcentered}3% of those in the highest quartile. Associations were independent of age, sex, demographic factors, and baseline mental and physical health. We conclude that the wellbeing of elderly people is an important objective for both economic and health policy. Present psychological and economic theories do not adequately account for the variations in patterns of wellbeing with age across different parts of the world. The apparent association between wellbeing and survival is consistent with a protective role of high wellbeing, but alternative explanations cannot be ruled out at this stage.},

@article{Casey2007,
abstract = {Given the extraordinary growth of the U.S. life settlement industry over the last decade, it is not surprising to find increased attention and scrutiny by academicians, the media and legal enforcement authorities–including, among others, state and federal securities regulatory and self-regulatory organizations. The securities laws regulators argue that investments in all forms of life settlement transactions involve the sale of securities, and that the full spectrum of securities laws applies. For the most part, they may be right. In discussing the pertinent securities-related issues surrounding life settlements, there are three fundamental questions to be addressed: 1) Does the sale of the life insurance policy to a passive investor that relies on others to conduct due diligence, price the policy, carry out the transaction, and perform follow-up services involve the sale of a "security" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act")? 2) Do the "registration" requirements under the 1933 Act apply? 3) Do sales activities in connection with the sale of the life insurance policy trigger any broker-dealer registration requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act")? This article concludes that the sale of the entire interest in an in-force life insurance policy to a passive investor may very well involve the sale of a security. The sale can be structured so that it is exempt from the registration requirements of state and federal laws. However, the state and federal anti-fraud provisions will apply to the transaction; and any person effecting the sale, particularly if compensated on the basis of the size of a successful sale, might be required to register with the SEC (and the applicable state) as a broker-dealer and be licensed as a security salesperson by the NASD.},

abstract = {The recent ability to trade longevity risk through the use of life settlements, whether for speculation, investment, or as a hedge, has far reaching implications for the entire financial sector. Currently, there are two active markets that trade in life settlements: the secondary market and the tertiary market. The secondary life insurance market is where a life insurance policy first enters the marketplace. The tertiary market is where individual policies and portfolios of policies come back into the market and are among between financial institutions. By providing the industry with secure, business-to-business trading platforms specifically designed for life settlement transactions, online platforms address many of the inefficiencies and shortcomings currently facing this industry. Online exchanges lower the fixed costs associated with brokering, underwriting, and purchasing a life insurance policy and consequently provide the opportunity for smaller policies to be brokered in the secondary market. Electronic trading platforms provide the ideal solution to monitor, update, and report upon the requlatory requirements of both buyers and sellers. Transparency and disclosure is probably the most compelling justification for the use of electronic platforms. For securitization to develop and flourish, an electronic exchange will need to be in place to facilitate trades and transactions.},

Perez analyzes the positive and negative aspects of these agreements from basic economic risk to ethical issues to tax implications. She analyzes recent regulatory developments in this area, including the Viatical Settlements Model Act and various state statutes. Perez recommends increased regulation at the state level, encouraging states to adopt the Model Act. She also recommends that these transactions be made tax-exempt and that attorneys play a greater role in the making of senior settlements. With these reforms, Perez suggests that the senior settlement agreement can be a safe and effective method by which seniors can realize financial freedom.},

abstract = {Historically, life insurance has been purchased to replace the lost income of the deceased. However, economic research and modeling of life insurance purchase decisions based on this idea have resulted in outcomes that question the validity of this assumption. One of these outcomes is that men do not seem to buy more life insurance when they are married. The other outcome is that high wealth households buy too much life insurance while low wealth households buy too little life insurance to maintain the family standard of living. The difference between married and single individuals and between high and low wealth individuals are highlighted in the estate tax. Low wealth individuals are not subject to the estate tax while high wealth individuals are subject to the estate tax. However, transfers of wealth to a spouse and the death benefits of life insurance (under certain conditions) are exempt from the estate tax. Empirical evidence suggests that high wealth individuals may be using life insurance for estate planning purposes and the inclusion of these tax treatments is essential to understanding the life insurance purchase decision. The impact of the estate tax on individual decisions regarding asset accumulation is modeled to quantify the policy implications of changes to the estate tax. These ideas of life insurance and the estate tax are extended to address their impact on entrepreneurship.},

abstract = {The paper offers an explanation for the evolution and increasing maturity of the life settlement market and the implications for all longevity based financial instruments and products by exploring the market dynamics and asset valuation processes. The paper begins by revisiting the brief history of the life settlement market before examining the market's evolution, finding that the increased participation in this multi-stage market has driven innovation, leading to the commoditization of various services and products which forces present service providers to either withdraw or adopt one of the operational marketing models, and lowers the barriers to entry for revolutionary service and product development. The paper then examines the value that the life settlement asset provides to both parties and establishes how that value is assessed. The paper finds that for impaired lives and specific other policies the settlement value is significantly greater than the surrender value, and that the calculation of worth to both buyer and seller must calculate both financial value and utilization value; the seller gains utilization from releasing liquidity, the buyer from portfolio diversification in an asset class whose underlying is at most weakly correlated to equities, bonds, real estate and commodities. The paper examines the value, considerations and risks for institutions considering investment in life settlements and other longevity based financial instruments. The paper finds that there are individual and market benefits from the asset class, that the asset class also creates macro-economic benefits, and that it is simply a matter of time before life based financial instruments join equities, bonds, real estate and commodities as a staple of portfolio diversification.},

@article{Blume1975,
abstract = {Beginning with a review of the conventional wisdom, the paper showed that estimated beta coefficients tend to regress towards the grand mean of all betas over time. The next section presented two kinds of empirical analyses which showed that part of this observed regression tendency represented real nonstationarities in the betas of individual securities and that the so-called order bias was not of overwhelming importance. In other words, companies of extreme risk--either high or low--tend to have less extreme risk characteristics over time. There are two logical explanations. First, the risk of existing projects may tend to become less extreme over time. This explanation may be plausible for high risk firms, but it would not seem applicable to low risk firms. Second, new projects taken on by firms may tend to have less extreme risk characteristics than existing projects. If this second explanation is correct, it is interesting to speculate on the reasons. For instance, is it a management decision or do limitations on the availability of profitable projects of extreme risk tend to cause the riskiness of firms to regress towards the grand mean over time? Though one could continue to speculate on the forces underlying this tendency of risk--as measured by beta coefficients--to regress towards the grand mean over time, it remains for future research to determine the explicit reasons.

The only reason this so-called life insurance secondary market can exist is because the subject policy has become much more valuable due to the insured's poor health.

@article{Friedberg2007,
abstract = {Insurance companies, employer pension plans, and the U.S. government all provide annuities and therefore assume aggregate mortality risk. Using the widely-cited Lee-Carter mortality model, we quantify aggregate mortality risk as the risk that the average annuitant lives longer than is predicted by the model, and we determine that annuities expose providers to substantial risk. We also find that other recent actuarial forecasts lie at the edge or outside of Lee-Carter's 95% confidence interval, suggesting even more uncertainty about future mortality.We then evaluate the implications of aggregate mortality risk for insurance companies; this analysis can be extended to private pension providers and Social Security. Given the forecasts of the Lee-Carter model, we calculate that a markup of 3.9% on an annuity premium (or shareholders' capital equal to 3.9% of the expected present value of annuity payments) would be required to reduce the probability of insolvency resulting from aggregate mortality shocks to 5%, and a markup of 5.7% would reduce the probability of insolvency to 1%. Based on the same model, we find that a projection scale commonly referred to by the insurance industry underestimates aggregate mortality improvements and would leave annuities underpriced.Annuity providers could manage aggregate mortality risk more efficiently by transferring it to financial markets through mortality-contingent bonds. We calculate the returns that one recently proposed mortality bond would have paid had it been available over a long period. Using both the Capital and the Consumption Capital Asset Pricing Models, we determine the risk premium that investors would have required to hold the bond. At plausible coefficients of risk aversion, annuity providers should be able to hedge aggregate mortality risk via such bonds at very low cost.},

abstract = {The life settlement business, which involves the sale of life insurance policies prior to maturity, is thriving. Unfortunately, the growth of the life settlement business has been fueled, at least in part, by stranger-originated life insurance (SOLI or STOLI or SPIN-LIFE) programs where brokers or speculators encourage individuals through economic incentives such as "free insurance," cruises, cash payments, and the like to acquire life insurance policies directly or indirectly on their lives, with the intent that the policies be sold over time to investors who have no insurable interest in their lives. The National Association of Life Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model act moved to end STOLI and strengthen consumer protection in the life settlement area. The National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL) model act serves as an alternative to the NAIC model act. This article summarizes the NCOIL model act and provides a broad-brush comparison of the NAIC and NCOIL model acts.},

abstract = {Time-preference shocks affect agents' preferences for assets with different durations. We consider longevity risk as a source of time-preference shocks and model it in the recursive preferences setting. This implies a consumption-based three-factor model, including longevity risk, consumption growth rate, and the market portfolio, where longevity has a negative price of risk. Empirically, this model explains many well-known cross-sectional portfolios. Notably, we find that longevity risk and the momentum factor share a common business cycle component, i.e., short-run consumption risks. Prior winners (losers)provide hedging against mortality (longevity)risk and thus have higher (lower)expected returns, because winners have higher dividend growth and shorter equity durations than losers. Time-varying longevity risk captures most momentum profits over time, including the large momentum crashes observed in the data.},

With very little federal oversight, the market flourished during the late '90s during the viatical settlement era and well into the 2000s in the form of the life settlement market. The financial meltdown that gripped the United States in late 2007 and continues today has garnered a call to action for the federal government to enact legislation to protect investors from abuses apparent in the investment community. It appears now that the legislative call to action may formally make its way into the LSIM. The Life Settlements Task Force ("LSTF"), created by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in August 2009, was established to investigate and examine issues in the LSIM and to advise the SEC whether market practices in and regulatory oversight of the LSIM could be improved. This article outlines the basic findings of the LSTF as well as detailing the potential repercussions of the federal government acting upon those recommendations.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze criteria for portfolio choice when two investors are forced to invest in a common portfolio and share the proceeds by a linear sharing rule. A similar situation with many investors is typical for defined contribution pension schemes. The restriction implies two sources of suboptimal investment decisions as seen from each of the two investors individually. One is the suboptimal choice of portfolio, the other is the forced linear sharing rule. We measure the combined consequence for each investor by their respective loss in wealth equivalent. We show that significant losses can arise when investors are diverse in their risk attitude. We also show that an investor with a low degree of risk aversion, like the logarithmic or the square root investor, often applied in portfolio choice models, can either inflict or be subject to severe losses when being forced to participate in such a common investment pool.},

The most striking result is that a majority of asset managers seem to substantially overvalue their portfolios relative to the prices of comparable transactions that have recently been closed. Drawing on market-consistent estimates with regard to medical underwriting, it is possible to trace back the observed discrepancies to inadequately low model inputs for life expectancies and discount rates. The main consequences are a dissimilar treatment of investor groups in open-end funds structures as well as an unduly high compensation for managers and third parties. To address this predicament, we suggest defining life settlements as level 2 assets in the fair value hierarchy of IFRS 13, improving transparency and disclosure requirements, and developing new incentive-compatible fee schedules.},

It is hypothesised that the assets have varying market characteristics and thus should respond differently to high inflation. The Fisher's hypothesis for asset-inflation hedging is constructed both within the bivariate and multivariate modelling frameworks. Thereafter, some salient features typical of predictive models such as asymmetry, time-variation and structural breaks are incorporated in the estimation process for completeness. The results show that inflation hedging tendencies of assets are heterogeneous across the considered assets. The real estates and stocks prove to be good hedges against inflation, while gold investment defies Fisher's hypothesis. Also, the results are sensitive to the decomposition of data for pre- and post-GFC periods, indicating that asset-inflation hedging relationship for the US is time-varying. The results are robust to alternative data frequencies.},

Those infected-at first, predominantly gay men-were often abandoned by their families, and government programs provided little support.},

abstract = {Over the past two years, the secondary market for life insurance policies, known as life settlements, has grown in the United States to a multi-billion dollar a year industry. Life settlement transactions have increased in volume and are likely to remain attractive due to the yields, the uncorrelated nature of the asset, and the flexibility available in structuring transactions that can accommodate investor preferences. Life settlements often can provide an alternative to seniors of which they were not previously aware. As the universe of parties that can facilitate life settlement transactions expands, more seniors will be presented with the possibility of doing a life settlement and the volume of transactions will increase. As the life settlement market continues to grow, the number of third-party service providers, such as verification agents and medical underwriters, is also likely to increase. The result will be a more robust and efficient market that will enable the participants to continue to benefit from this unique asset.},

abstract = {We investigate why life insurance policies in practice either do not have a cash surrender value (CSV), or have CSVs that are small and are not adjusted for health status. We show that including health-contingent CSVs in a life insurance contract causes a dynamic commitment problem, which makes it more costly up front for policyholders to purchase long-term contracts (because some poor risks who would otherwise have lapsed can and will now capture the CSV instead). To the extent that life insurance policyholders' incomes tend to increase over the course of the policy, policyholders are not willing to accept higher ex ante premium costs in return for the extra liquidity provided by the CSV. Because health-contingent CSVs act in a similar way to a life settlement market, we also study the life insurers' equilibrium choice of CSVs in the presence of a life settlement market. We find that optimally chosen CSVs can partially mitigate the consumer welfare loss caused by the settlement market (as in Daily, Hendel, and Lizzeri, 2008), but only if the CSVs are allowed to be contingent on health status.},

abstract = {We investigate the claim that hedge funds offer investors a superior risk-return tradeoff. We do so using a continuous-time version of Dybvig's (1988a), (1988b) payoff distribution pricing model. The evaluation model, which does not require any assumptions with regard to the return distribution of the funds to be evaluated, is applied to the monthly returns of 77 hedge funds and 13 hedge fund indices from May 1990-April 2000. The results show that, as a stand-alone investment, hedge funds do not offer a superior risk-return profile. We find 12 indices and 72 individual funds to be inefficient, with the average efficiency loss amounting to 2.76% per annum for indices and 6.42% for individual funds. Part of the inefficiency cost of individual funds can be diversified away. Funds of funds, however, are not the preferred vehicle for this as their performance appears to suffer badly from their double fee structure. Looking at hedge funds in a portfolio context results in a marked improvement in the evaluation outcomes. Seven of the 12 hedge fund indices and 58 of the 72 individual funds classified as inefficient on a stand-alone basis are capable of producing an efficient payoff profile when mixed with the S&P 500. The best results are obtained when 10%-20% of the portfolio value is invested in hedge funds. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In addition to the 28 states that regulated life settlements a year ago, several additional states have either adopted life settlement laws or have proposed legislation that is pending. One common goal shared both by states that adopted new legislation and by those that revised existing legislation was the elimination of stranger-originated life insurance (STOLI). There are two categories of proposed and pending legislation: 1) legislation based on the Viatical Settlements Model Act, and 2) legislation based on the model legislation introduced by the National Conference of Insurance Legislators (NCOIL). On the structured finance front, the continued absence of a widely available and accepted insurance product covering the longevity risk inherent in life settlements, and the dislocation in the asset-backed market as a whole, have combined to further delay the eagerly awaited arrival of a pure, rated, life settlement securitization.},

abstract = {Recent turbulence in the financial markets has highlighted the need for diversified portfolios with lower correlations between the different investments. Life settlements meet this need, offering investors the prospect of high, stable returns, uncorrelated with the broader financial markets.This book provides readers of all levels of experience with essential information on the process surrounding the acquisition and management of a portfolio of life settlements; the assessment, modelling and mitigation of the associated longevity, interest rate and credit risks; and practical approaches to financing and risk management structures. It begins with the history of life insurance and looks at how the need for new financing sources has led to the growth of the life settlements market in the United States.The authors provide a detailed exploration of the mathematical formulae surrounding the generation of mortality curves, drawing a parallel between the tools deployed in the credit derivatives market and those available to model longevity risk. Structured products and securitisation techniques are introduced and explained, starting with simple vanilla products and models before illustrating some of the investment structures associated with life settlements. Capital market mechanisms available to assist the investor in limiting the risks associated with life settlement portfolios are outlined, as are opportunities to use life settlement portfolios to mitigate the risks of traditional capital markets. The last section of the book covers derivative products, either available now or under consideration, that will reduce or potentially eliminate longevity risks within life settlement portfolios. It then reviews hedging and risk management strategies and considers how to measure the effectiveness of risk mitigation.},

Today's life settlement transactions bear little or no resemblance to the viatical sales of yore. Owners of an insurance contract can collect the proceeds payable under the contract upon the death of the insured, or they can sell the policy for its current market value. Institutional investors have come to realize that big blocks of properly underwritten policies acquired through life settlements can form a very predictable, very conservative, and very profitable source of income.

This risk transfer occurs in conjunction with an information transfer that is relevant not only for pricing, but also for risk management. In this analysis, we compare the efficiency of two different hedging instruments in managing the mortality risk of the life settlement firm. First, we claim and then demonstrate that conventional longevity-linked securities do not perform as effectively in the secondary life market, that is, life settlement market, as in the annuity and pension markets due to the basis risk that exists between the general population and the life settlement subgroup. Second, we show that the unique risk exposure of the life settlement firm can be specifically targeted using a new instrument--the biomedical research-backed obligations. Our finding connects two seemingly independent markets and can promote the healthy development of both.},

For investors who can develop reliable actuarial models and establish long-term business processes, this option presents a means of diversifying a portfolio with non-correlated assets. Despite the number of willing investors and the frequency with which these transactions are occurring, no "cookie cutter" transaction type, or business structure, is predominant in the industry. That is, there is a variety of participants in terms of form of entity, domestic and foreign locale, degrees of active participation in the operation of the "business," sophistication and needs as to actuarial and business modeling, and expectations regarding buying and holding and securitizing the policies. Among the more significant drivers of this variation in structuring is a given investor's identification and understanding of the numerous tax issues that are potentially involved. The problem, however, has been the apparent lack of guidance as to how to apply potentially applicable tax rules that were not drafted with this evolving industry in mind.

All the patterns in the data fit the theoretical predictions of a model with symmetric learning and one-sided commitment {\`{a}} la Harris and Holmstom. The lack of commitment by consumers shapes contracts in the way predicted by the theory: all contracts involve front-loading (prepayment) of premiums. Front-loading generates a partial lock-in of consumers; more front-loading is associated with lower lapsation. Moreover, contracts that are more front-loaded have a lower present value of premiums over the period of coverage. This is consistent with the idea that front-loading enhances consumer commitment and that more front-loaded contracts retain better risk pools.},

abstract = {In this article the authors define a reference time called t0, in longevity/value space, as the longevity that drives a life settlement contract to a zero value. They develop the t0 metric to show how the "longevity gap" collapses and expands as actual longevity of the pool of insured deviates from the forecasted longevity upon which the pricing of the life settlement contracts is based. The "longevity gap" or "gap" measures the value of the asset component of a life settlement contract (the death benefits), relative to the value of the liability component (the required premium payments). The longevity gap metric can be used by investors and creditors to measure the solvency of individual life settlement contracts or portfolios of life settlement contracts. Because the value of the asset side of a life settlement contract expands and declines at a different rate than the liability side when longevity changes, t0 becomes a threshold that investors can use to gauge and compare the longevity risk embedded in life settlement contracts that are being offered. The authors show that policies valued by simply discounting the stream of cash flows of life settlement contracts based on an expected longevity of the underlying population of insured can be misleading. Knowing at what longevity of the insured the policy will hit t0 offers valuable information.},

abstract = {American law requires an insurable interest—a pecuniary or affective stake in the subject of an insurance policy—as a predicate to properly obtaining insurance. In theory, the rule prevents both wagering on individual lives and moral hazard. In practice, the doctrine is avoided by complex insurance transaction structuring to effectuate both origination and transfers of insurance by individuals without an insurable interest. This paper argues that it is time to abandon the insurable interest doctrine. As both the English and Australian experiences indicate, elimination of the insurable interest doctrine will have little detrimental pecuniary effect on the insurance industry, while freeing consumers considerably. Indeed, New York comes to the brink of eliminating the doctrine in its recent decision in Kramer v. Phoenix Life Insurance Co. by sanctioning an immediate life insurance assignment procedure that in effect eliminates the need for an insurable interest in the assignee. However, Delaware, in PHL Variable Insurance Co. v. Price Dawe 2006 Insurance Trust and Lincoln National Life Insurance Co. v. Joseph Schlanger 2006 Insurance Trust, breathes new life into an old doctrine. Overall, though, adhering to an arcane doctrine that prevents the value of an insurance policy from being realized without extreme legal burden both hampers the market and harms consumers, as the benefits of such transactions are both lessened by transaction costs and accrue to only a select few individuals.},

abstract = {We analyze the effects of life insurance settlement on insurance contract design, the insurer's profit and welfare. Policyholders face not only mortality risks but also heterogeneous liquidity risks which lead the policyholders to surrender or settle the policies. It is assumed that the insurer cannot discriminate policyholders based on liquidity risks, and that no cost is incurred in surrender and settlement. We characterize the conditions for the endogenous existence of a settlement market, and find that the settlement market, if it exists, raises insurance premium. The effects of settlement on profit and welfare depend on the market structure. In the monopolistic insurance market, the settlement market lowers the insurer's profit, and consumer welfare increases whenever demand increases and possibly increases even when demand decreases. This finding is in contrast with most of the existing studies reporting that settlement never has a positive effect on welfare. In the competitive insurance market, welfare always decreases.},

abstract = {An interview with Martyn S. Babitz, an attorney and senior wealth planner with PNC Advisors' Wealth Planning Group, regarding strategies using life settlements, is presented. The actual amount a policyowner will receive from a viatical or senior settlement will depend on numerous factors, including: 1. the type of policy being sold, 2. the face amount (death benefit) of the policy, and 3. the amount of future premium obligations (which will no longer be the insured's obligation). The proceeds of an insurance policy held by the insured on his or her life are included in the gross estate of the policyowner if he or she dies owning the policy. To avoid estate tax on these insurance proceeds, the owner may want to give the policy to an irrevocable trust or outright to the intended beneficiary(ies). But, under Section 2035, if the owner dies within three years of such a transfer, the death proceeds will be included in his or her taxable estate. To avoid this problem, the policyowner could sell the policy and at some later date, gift the proceeds of the sale.},

At first glance the financial crisis should actually spur the growth of the market in senior life settlements. This is because on the supply side of the market significant amounts of wealth of senior citizens have been lost in the stock, bond, and real estate markets. On the other hand, factors on the demand side of the market have reduced the offered prices for life insurance policies. Interestingly, the most dramatic event that impacted the life settlements market as the financial markets entered the crisis stage in the autumn of 2008, was the decision by the directors of 21st Services to revise their mortality tables. The author concludes that the element that creates a sustainable market in life settlements is the increased transparency of pricing on both sides of the market.},

The "lasso" minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly zero and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.

abstract = {This paper puts forth two models, one of a bank and one of an insurer. Their divisions responsible for investment (and risk underwriting, respectively) seek to maximize the expected risk-adjusted rate of return on capital (RAROC). For the bank, higher solvency lowers the cost of refinancing; for the insurer, it attracts more premium income. In both cases, however, higher solvency ties costly capital. Sequential decision making is tracked over three periods. In period 1, exogenous changes in expected returns and in volatility occur, each suggesting optimal adjustments in solvency. However, there can be only one adjustment, which in period 3 creates an endogenous trade-off between expected returns and volatility. This tradeoff is shown to involve parameters that differ between banks and insurers, calling for bank-specific and insurance-specific solvency regulation. In addition, Basel I and II (Solvency I and II, respectively) are shown to modify this tradeoff, inducing senior management of both banks and insurers to opt for higher volatility and lower solvency than otherwise. Therefore, existing solvency regulation can run counter their stated objective in both cases, which quite likely is also true of Basel III and Solvency III.},

abstract = {This article addresses the micro‐analytic foundations of illiquidity and price dynamics in the real estate market by integrating modern portfolio theory with models describing the real estate transaction process. Based on the notion that real estate is a heterogeneous good that is traded in decentralized markets and that transactions in these markets are often characterized by costly searches, we argue that the most important aspects defining real estate illiquidity in both residential and commercial markets are the time required for sale and the uncertainty of the marketing period. These aspects provide two sources of bias in the commonly adopted methods of real estate valuation, which are based solely on the prices of sold properties and implicitly assume immediate execution. We demonstrate that estimated returns must be biased upward and risks downward. These biases can be significant, especially when the marketing period is highly uncertain relative to the holding period. We also find that real estate risk is closely related to investors' time horizons, specifically that real estate risk decreases when the holding period increases. These results are consistent with the conventional wisdom that real estate is more favorable to long‐term investors than to short‐term investors. They also provide a theoretical foundation for the recent econometric literature, which finds evidence of smoothing of real estate returns. Our findings help explain the apparent risk‐premium puzzle in real estate—that is, that ex post returns appear too high, given their apparent low volatility—and can lead to the formal derivation of adjustments that can define real estate's proper role in the mixed‐asset portfolio.},

This article provides a framework for the development of a methodology for the investment community to understand potential deviations from expected experience for a life settlement portfolio. When considering an investment in an asset in which cash flows are backed by the economics of life insurance policies, the investor should consider 1) eligibility guidelines for the pool of lives underlying the investment, and 2) expected return on the investment and related risks. Because mortality risk is the primary risk, an understanding of the underwriting process for each individual life insurance policy is a key to analyzing the investment.},
